      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am an independent researcher exploring social movements, political transformations, and the neuroscience of collective behavior.  
        My work focuses on how societies and communities move from victimhood to strategic agency and long-term self-determination.

      <h2>Current Work</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently engaged in a broad interdisciplinary study examining how nations and communities move beyond a victim identity to take collective responsibility for their future.  
        This inquiry draws inspiration from historical examples such as the long-term strategies developed by the Jewish people, who transformed centuries of persecution into resilience, planning, and self-determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus is on understanding:  
        <ul>
          <li>What internal and external factors enable a society to shift from seeing itself primarily as a victim to becoming an active agent of change?</li>
          <li>How do education, cultural narratives, and leadership contribute to decade-long planning and sustained organizational capacity?</li>
          <li>To what extent can models of resilience and collective responsibility be adapted for nations with different histories, values, and social dynamics?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        To explore these questions, I am reviewing literature in political psychology, social neuroscience, and historical case studies of nation-building. I am also analyzing how identity formation, intergenerational memory, and cultural institutions shape a people's capacity to organize strategically and pursue long-term goals.
